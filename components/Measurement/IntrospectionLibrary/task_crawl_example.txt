# This is the serial output from the simulated seL4 image.
# It shows first the results of our introspective crawl over the process
# tree. Following that is the list of current processes reported by
# `ps`. The introspected list is a superset of the `ps` list. Our user
# tasks finish after measurement, so they are not displayed after login
# because they are not running. Additionally, it seems the swapper task
# is being hidden, which is fine; nobody but me needs to worry about the
# swapper task.
